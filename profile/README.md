# Dogumentation

**Tertier the Doguhorse, your modern dogumentation friend.**

CLI-first. Language-agnostic. Who let the docs out?

## What’s going on here?

This org is building a documentation tool you run from the CLI and it just… gives you docs.

No giant framework.
No yak shaving.
No “configure 14 plugins before hello world”.

You point it at a repo. It reads the code. It produces structured, readable Dogumentation.

That’s the whole idea.

## What we care about

- Docs should be **easy to generate**
- Output should be **clean and predictable**
- Tools should **fit your repo**, not take it over
- Good documentation is part of good developer experience

We like boring output, sharp tools, and things that run in CI without drama.

## What’s being built

Things will show up here as they’re ready, but the rough shape is:

- A core CLI that analyzes repositories and produces docs
- Language support starting with TypeScript
- Themes and templates that don’t look like a 2009 wiki
- Example repos so you can see real input → real output

Slowly at first. Then faster.

## Meet the mascot

**Doguhorse**
Also known as the **Tertier Terrier**.

Part deep-sea explorer, part nerd partnered with you.
Full-time documentation gremlin.

He dives into your codebase and comes back with organized, readable Dogumentation. Probably wearing glasses. Definitely judging your folder structure (lovingly).

## Contributing

This is early-stage, so things will change a lot.

When contributions open up:

- Clear issues are gold
- Repro steps are better than opinions
- Small, focused PRs beat giant rewrites

More structure will come as the project stabilizes.
